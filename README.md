### Overview

It’s all about stimulating: the curiosity of recurring and short-time travellers, emerging and thriving local businesses, a colourful approach to concrete jungle.

### UX

This is a website addressed to business people of all ages, genders, nationalities and industries who are willing to explore Sao Paulo from beyond the glass-walled buildings. The main functionality of this website is to offer options of what to do in the free time according to users preferences and time spent in the city.
Vivid images, curated content and maps are essential for this project.

#### 1. Strategy

Straightforward and enticing at the same time, the UX seeks a balance between relevant information and viable schedules. The outcome has to be the right amount of options to the right amount of time. 
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
Become a reference on recommendations for varied types of business travellers
Help users make the best use of free time while in Sao Paulo
Promote tourism, portraying Sao Paulo as more than a financial and business centre
Grow a valuable customer database to local businesses
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
Mobile-first approach, to help users on-the-go
Interactive maps that allow users to navigate in their area
Mail list to get recommendations and travel plans in advance
Curated and easy to find information


#### 2. Scope

The idea is to keep it quick, simple and meaningful, just as our visitors' business trip. The challenge here is to be straightforward and enticing at the same time, taking into account the limited time our visitors will have to explore the city. For this reason, a constantly updated list of the top 10 things to do in Sao Paulo is the easiest way to help users create their own itineraries.

#### 3. Structure

An inviting homepage bearing a carousel of appealing photos of Sao Paulo
Summary about the city
Curated content in 4 call-to-action clusters (Eat, Visit, Enjoy, Shop) that help users to create a tour itinerary
Social media links allow visitors to deep-dive in São Paulo to see a wider range of options

#### 5. Surface

Colours: a combination of dark tones and vibrant colours makes it classy and contemporary while suggestive. (indicar paleta de cores?)

Typography: choices favor comfort to the eye in mobile and are in line with a practical approach (indicar fontes escolhidas e ver se precisa acrescentar algo aqui)

Images: high-quality, bright pictures with the power to appeal to visitors’ curiosity

Maps: interactive maps allow visitors to check areas of interest (ver se tem alguma função nos mapas que não citei aqui)

Design Choices (aqui acho que tem que ser depois de executar pra ver se tem algo que valha ser mencionado)
